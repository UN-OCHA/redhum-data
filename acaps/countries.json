Zimbabwe is currently experiencing an economic crisis, which is having a major impact on the cost and availability of food and fuel. With legitimate and alternative currencies quickly de-valuing against the US dollar, inflation and liquidity shortages are expected to worsen unless serious measures are taken. Should the economy collapse, as in 2008, serious humanitarian consequences regarding food security and health are very likely.</p><p>At least 3.9 million people are expected to suffer from food insecurity until at least March 2019,&nbsp;a significant increase&nbsp;from the estimated 567,000 people classified as food insecure in June 2018. The rural population of Zimbabwe is the most affected.&nbsp;Multiple issues affect food prices, access and availability. At the same time cholera and typhoid outbreaks are putting extreme pressure on Zimbabwe&rsquo;s underfunded health system and dilapidated WASH infrastructure.</p><p>INFORM measures Zimbabwe&rsquo;s&nbsp;risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster at 5.2/10. Lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are of particular&nbsp;concern at 5.7/10 and 5.2/10 respectively.<a href=\"#\" title=\"http://www.inform-index.org/Portals/0/InfoRM/2019/Country_Profiles/ZWE.pdf\">?</a></p><div>&nbsp;</div>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>10/4&nbsp;</strong>Low precipitation rates during the current rainy season in central and western Zimbabwe have left reservoirs far below their usual water level.
