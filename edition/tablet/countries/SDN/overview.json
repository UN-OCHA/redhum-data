Darfur has been the scene of conflict for over a decade, while violence in Blue Nile and South Kordofan increased significantly after South Sudan gained independence in 2011. &nbsp;</p><p>Humanitarian access to conflict zones is severely restricted and remains so despite efforts of the AU and UN to broker a peace agreement and ensure increased humanitarian access. &nbsp;Violence, food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to basic services have caused large-scale internal displacement. &nbsp;</p><p>According to INFORM, Sudan is at high risk of being overwhelmed by humanitarian crises and disasters (7.6/10). Hazard, vulnerability, and a lack of coping capacity are at alarming rates of 8.1/10, 6.9/10, and 7.9/10.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.inform-index.org/Countries/Country-Profile-Map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Inform 2018\">?</a></p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>03/12:&nbsp;</strong>A total of 90 suspected&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/sudan/crisis-analysis#datacard-39089\">dengue fever</a> cases including 2 deaths (CFR: 2.2%) have&nbsp;been&nbsp;reported across the states of Khartoum, Kassala, East Darfur, West Darfur, South Kordofan and Red Sea between October and mid-November. <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Epi_Monitor_2017_10_49.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WHO 03/12/2017\">?</a></p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
