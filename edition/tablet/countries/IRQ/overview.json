Large scale displacement persists following the expulsion of Islamic State from Iraqi territory, with 2.4 million people left internally displaced after the IS invasion and subsequent military operations. Over 3.3 million IDPs have returned to their areas of origin since October 2016 and the number of returnees continues to increase.&nbsp;Forced returns are also reported as IDP camps continue to close. &nbsp;&nbsp;Returnees in many areas lack basic services, livelihood opportunities, and still face insecurity due to extremist pockets throughout the country. Ninewa is the epicentre of the crisis, hosting 46% of Iraqis who need humanitarian assistance. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ihf_2018_sa1_allocation_strategy_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 15/02/2018\">?</a></p><p>INFORM measures Iraq&rsquo;s&nbsp;risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.8/10.
