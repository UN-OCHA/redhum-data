This is mainly due to conflict and displacements. Conflict in both Nigeria and CAR has led to displacement of refugees to Cameroon. There&nbsp;are over 210,000 refugees from CAR and around 90,000 from Nigeria. CAR refugees are mainly located in the East and Adamaoua regions, and remain strictly dependent from humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;The majority of refugees from Nigeria live in Minawao camp, in Far North region. Protection, WASH, and livelihood are among the most severe needs for Nigerian refugees in Cameroon. The Anglophone crisis ongoing since late 2016 is disrupting education and livelihood systems in Southwest and Northwest regions, and driving internal displacement as well as refugees into neighbouring Nigeria.</p><p>INFORM considers&nbsp;that the risk of humanitarian crisis varies widely, from very high in the Far North to very low in western areas of the country. Nationally, the risk is 6.2/10. Hazard and exposure risk stands at 6.8, and lack of coping capacity at 6/10.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.inform-index.org/Countries/Country-Profile-Map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"INFORM 2016\">?</a>&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>10/04</strong>: Several thousand people have been internally displaced by the Anglophone crisis in Southwest and Northwest regions, including an estimated <a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/cameroon/crisis-analysis#datacard-43548\">40,000 IDPs</a> recorded in Mamfe and Kumba (Southwest region) alone.<a href=\"http://www.cameroon-info.net/article/cameroun-besoins-humanitaires-croissants-dans-des-zones-anglophones-isolees-319671.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cameroon-Info 10/04/2018\">?</a></p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
