This is mainly due to conflict and displacements. Conflict in both Nigeria and CAR has led to displacement of refugees to Cameroon. There&nbsp;are over 210,000 refugees from CAR and around 90,000 from Nigeria. CAR refugees are mainly located in the East and Adamaoua regions, and remain strictly dependent from humanitarian assistance.&nbsp;The majority of refugees from Nigeria live in Minawao camp, in Far North region. Protection, WASH, and livelihood are among the most severe needs for Nigerian refugees in Cameroon.&nbsp;</p><p>INFORM considers&nbsp;that the risk of humanitarian crisis varies widely, from very high in the Far North to very low in western areas of the country. Nationally, the risk is 6.2/10. Hazard and exposure risk stands at 6.8, and lack of coping capacity at 6/10.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.inform-index.org/Countries/Country-Profile-Map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"INFORM 2016\">?</a>&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>26/01: </strong>At least <a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/cameroon/crisis-analysis#datacard-40402\">11,000 Cameroonians</a><a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/cameroon/crisis-analysis#datacard-40166\">&nbsp;</a>have arrived in Nigeria since end of September, fleeing the tense political situation in the Anglophone regions of Southwest and Northwest.<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/61735.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UNHCR 26/01/2018\">?</a></p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
