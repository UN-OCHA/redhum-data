[{"index":0,"name":"Afghanistan","overview":{"name":"Overview","text":"Assistance needs due to armed conflict and frequent natural disasters include food, healthcare, and protection. With the increase in the number of people internally displaced by conflict and the influx of returnees, shelter and WASH needs have increased significantly. 9.3 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.However, the high level of insecurity constrains access.\nThe Taliban increased its influence throughout 2015 – including attacks on provincial capitals towards the end of the year – and this has continued in 2016. The Islamic State (IS) presence has been growing in the east, with significant activity reported in Nangarhar. \nAbuses against Afghans in Pakistan appear to have worsened substantially since June. This has resulted in a mass influx of Afghans from Pakistan back into Afghanistan, putting a strain on the resources and coping capacity of the Afghan government and humanitarian organisations. At the same time, thousands of Afghans are returning from Iran either spontaneously or through deportation, adding to the numbers of internally displaced and people in need in Afghanistan. In the coming months, thousands of Afghan asylum seekers are expected to return as a result of a deal between the European Union and the Afghan government.\nINFORM measures Afghanistan’s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 7.8/10. Afghanistan’s hazard is of particular concern, at 8.8/10.","date":"2017-01-20T02:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","url":"http://www.acaps.org/country/afghanistan"},"iso3":"AFG","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/afg","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/afg.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/afg.png","figures":[{"name":"People

than 20 years. Conflict between foreign, self-defence, and other armed groups, mainly impacting the eastern provinces, has left the country in a state of prolonged, severe humanitarian crisis. Although the security situation has improved slightly since 2013 when the government defeated M23 in Nord-Kivu, conflict continues. Access remains volatile in the east, and lack of infrastructure is a general problem across the country. Clashes between armed groups and the DRC armed forces are affecting populations mainly in Sud- and Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Health is a priority due to recurrent measles, cholera, and malaria outbreaks, and protection concerns are high because of serious human rights violations in the eastern provinces.\nIn 2016, the ruling coalition has sought to prolong President Joseph Kabila’s time in office beyond December 2016, when his constitutional two-term limit was due to end. A new agreement was reached on 31 December 2016 stating that President Kabila would step down after the next election. Voting is to take place before the end of the year. In 2016, election-related violence increased. Protests related to the forthcoming presidential elections have taken place in Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Bukavu, and Goma. Election-related human rights violations, including summary executions, death threats, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly have been reported since 2015.\nINFORM measures DRC's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 7/10. Lack of coping capacity is of particular concern, at 8/10 as well as vulnerability at 7/10.","date":"2017-01-12T10:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","url":"http://www.acaps.org/country/drc"},"iso3":"COD","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/cod","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/cod.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/cod.png","figures":[{"name":"People

An increase in attacks from Islamist armed groups was reported at the beginning of November. \nOverall, a lack of access to basic social services and the low capacity of public administration drives humanitarian needs. While IDPs and refugees have slowly been returning home since 2013, over 36,700 people remain internally displaced and around 136,000 refugees are still in neighbouring countries. \nINFORM measures Mali's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.6/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are all at alarming levels, at 6.2/10, 6.8/10 and 6.7/10

Access constraints in areas of conflict increase the difficulty of reaching populations in need.\nIn Rakhine state, discrimination against the Rohingya Muslim minority has caused protracted displacement. IDPs in Rakhine have limited access to services as they are confined to camps. Since 9 October, tensions between the Rohingya and the Myanmar Army have escalated. Security operations by the Myanmar Army since 9 October restrict access to northern Rakhine and have halted all existing aid operations.\nThe end of 2015 saw landmark elections and a national ceasefire agreement, but several groups are still in armed conflict with the government, predominantly in Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine states.\nINFORM measures Myanmar's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster as very high, at 6.7/10. Hazard and exposure, as well as lack of coping capacity, and vulnerability are all at high levels, at 7.5/10, 6/10 and 6.6/10

with interclan fighting and a severe El Niño-induced drought, has created large-scale displacement and made basic services almost inaccessible for an estimated 5 million Somalis. The INFORM index score for risk of humanitarian catastrophe ranks Somalia at 9.2 out of 10, the highest of any country. Humanitarian access remains extremely limited outside of Somaliland: Lower and Middle Juba regions are particularly inaccessible. The government's control is essentially limited to Mogadishu and surrounding areas, although Al Shabaab attacks in the city persist. The first parliamentary elections since 1967 are scheduled for the end of January 2017, despite political, security, and clan-related challenges. Both the elections and continued insecurity have led to limited national and international response to the ongoing drought, which has spread to new areas of southcentral Somalia, Puntland, and Somaliland.","date":"2017-01-18T19:00:00.000Z","source":"ACAPS","url":"https://www.acaps.org/country/somalia"},"iso3":"SOM","url":"http://reliefweb.int/country/som","map":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images/som.png","image":"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/country-location-images-large/som.png","figures":[{"name":"People

in Yemen in March 2015. 18.8 million people are in need of humanitarian aid, including 10.3 million people in acute need. \nAn armed advance on the capital in September 2014 by Houthis from the north has led to civil war throughout the country. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia has supported the Yemeni government with airstrikes since March 2015. Activities by southern secessionists Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Islamic State (IS) compound the security and political challenges.\nThe humanitarian situation is further exacerbated by Yemen’s failing economy. The Central Bank in Yemen is near collapse, putting food imports at risk.\nThe Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) declared Yemen a Level 3 emergency in July 2015. INFORM measures Yemen's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster at a very high level of 7.6/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity and vulnerability are all at alarming levels: 8.2/10, 7.9/10 and 7.8/10
