Rainfall levels through mid-April are expected to be the lowest on record since 1981 and the deficit is forecast to continue into May. The water shortage is already resulting in increased commodity prices, deterioration of livestock and agropastoral conditions, and displacement of people. Approximately 1.7 million people are now estimated to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) between April and June, an increase of 10% from the previous projection of 1.5 million for February to June. Early action is needed to avert a food security and nutrition crisis by scaling up immediate life-saving assistance.<a href=\"#\" title=\"FEWS NET 29/04/2019 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/FSNAU-Food-Security-Quarterly-Brief-April-2019.pdfECHO 27/04/2019 https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-early-warning-signs-severe-drought-and-major-humanitarian-crisis-dg-echo-ocha\">?</a></p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
