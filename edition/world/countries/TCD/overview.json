Security threats around Lake Chad, most notably from Boko Haram (BH), and military operations to contain them have repeatedly driven civilians from their homes and disrupted livelihoods. Insecurity has also pushed Nigerian refugees into Chad since 2014, creating a complex displacement crisis spread across multiple sites on the islands and shores of the lake Chad. Large and protracted refugee populations, mainly from Sudan and CAR, in the south and east of the country also face significant humanitarian needs.<br>INFORM measures Chad's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster is high at 7.8/10. Vulnerability as well as lack of coping capacity are of particular concern, at 7.4/10 and 8.9/10.</p>"}
