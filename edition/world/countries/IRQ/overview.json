There are 2.56 million IDPs as a result of IS invasion and military operations. The number of returnees is increasing and over 3.2 million IDPs have returned to their areas of origin since October 2016. However, many areas which IDPs are returning to lack basic services, livelihood opportunities and still face insecurity due to extremist pockets throughout the country. Another concerning matter is the issue of forced returns which are continually reported as IDP camp closure continues to take place.&nbsp;IDPs and Syrian refugees make up 25% of the population in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KR-I).<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/20180126%20UNHCR%20Iraq%20Flash%20Update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UNHCR  26/1/18\">?</a><a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/UNHCR%20Iraq%20Factsheet%20January%202018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"UNHCR 20/1/18\">?</a></p><p>INFORM measures Iraq&rsquo;s&nbsp;risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 6.8/10.
