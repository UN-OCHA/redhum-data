Tensions between two of the signatories of the 2015 peace deal, the Azawad Movement Coalition (CMA) and the Groupe Autodéfense Touareg Imghad et Alliés(GATIA), periodically flare into conflict. Attacks by Islamist armed groups, who are not part of the peace agreement, increased in 2016 and have continued into 2018. Conflict and insecurity are driving displacement and humanitarian needs in the affected areas. The most important needs are food security, health and protection. Timbuktu, Gao and Mopti regions are the areas with the most people in need of assistance. However, capacity to respond is severely limited due to a lack of access in the conflict-affected areas.<br>Mali is also a country of destination and of transit for migrants coming from sub-Saharan Africa who want to travel to Algeria, Mauritania and/or Europe. During their journey, those migrants lack protection assistance and are vulnerable to armed attacks.<br>INFORM measures Mali's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 6/10. Hazard, exposure, a lack of coping capacity, and vulnerability are all at concerning levels, at 5.3/10, 6.8/10 and 6/10 respectively.</p>"}
