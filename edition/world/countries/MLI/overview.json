Tensions between two of the signatories of the 2015 peace deal, the Azawad Movement Coalition (CMA) and the Groupe Autod&eacute;fense Touareg Imghad et Alli&eacute;s (GATIA), periodically flare into conflict. &nbsp;Attacks by Islamist armed groups, who are not part of the peace agreement, increased in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, a lack of access to basic social services and the low presence and capacity of public administration drives humanitarian needs.
