Clashes between Dogon (pastoralist farmers) and Fulani (nomadic herders) communities over land and access to water points have also increased in central and northern regions,&nbsp;fuelled by the presence of Islamist armed groups and the recruitment of Fulani herders.<a href=\"#\" title=\"FIDH 20/11/2018https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/fidh_centre_du_mali_les_populations_prises_au_pie_ge_du_terrorisme_et_contre_terrorisme.pdf IRIN 04/09/2018http://www.irinnews.org/news-feature/2018/09/04/mali-fulani-dogon-extremism-stirs-intercommunal\">?</a></p><p>Insecurity has disrupted economic and trade activities, resulting in the unreliable availability of food in the markets. Prices have increased, especially in the Mopti, Timbuktu, and Gao regions. Risks of banditry and attacks along commercial roads have deterred traders. Limited access to farmlands and the disruption of normal transhumance patterns due to insecurity have affected livelihoods. Although food production is expected to improve overall in the country due to an adequate level of rainfall in 2018, populations affected by the conflict remain food insecure. IEDs are commonly used by armed groups in northern and central Mali to target Malian or MINUSMA military convoys, and have affected a growing number of civilians in 2018.
