Tensions between two of the signatories of the 2015 peace deal, the Azawad Movement Coalition (CMA) and the&nbsp;<em>Groupe Autod&eacute;fense Touareg Imghad et Alli&eacute;s</em>(GATIA), periodically flare into conflict. Attacks by Islamist armed groups, who are not part of the peace agreement, increased in 2016 and have continued into 2018. Conflict and insecurity are driving displacement and humanitarian needs in the affected areas. The most important needs are food security, health and protection. Timbuktu, Gao and Mopti regions are the areas with the most people in need of assistance. However, capacity to respond is severely limited due to a lack of access in the conflict-affected areas.<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/mali_hrp_2018_vfinale.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 04/02/2018\">?</a></p><p>Mali is also a country of destination and of transit for migrants coming from sub-Saharan Africa who want to travel to Algeria, Mauritania and/or Europe.
