Separatists now control most of eastern Donetsk region, and a small area of southern Luhansk region. 3.4&nbsp;million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and over 1.5&nbsp;million have been displaced. Protection and health are of particular concern in conflict areas, particularly as a large number of older people are affected.
