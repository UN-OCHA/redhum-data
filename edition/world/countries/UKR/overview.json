Separatists now control most of eastern Donetsk region, and a small area of southern Luhansk region. 3.4&nbsp;million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and almost 1.5&nbsp;million have been displaced. Protection and health are of particular concern in conflict areas, particularly as a large number of older people are affected. Humanitarian access is constrained and has deteriorated in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/operations/ukraine/document/ukraine-2018-humanitarian-needs-overview-hno\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 30/11/2017\">?</a><a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/report_november-december_2017_eng.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IOM 18/12/2017\">?</a>&nbsp;</p><p>INFORM measures Ukraine&#39;s&nbsp;risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 5.4/10.
