Separatists now control most of eastern Donetsk region, and a small area of southern Luhansk region. 4&nbsp;million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than 2.8&nbsp;million have been displaced. Protection and health are of particular concern in conflict areas, particularly as a large number of older people are affected. Humanitarian access is constrained: virtually all international aid organisations (all in Donestk) have been banned from non-government areas. <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/echo/files/aid/countries/factsheets/ukraine_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ECHO 19/01/2017\">?</a>&nbsp;However, in September 2016 UNHCR&rsquo;s license to operate in Donetsk and surrounding areas was renewed.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/ukraine-line\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Crisis Group 18/07/2016\">?</a></p><p>INFORM measures Ukraine&#39;s&nbsp;risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 5.3/10.
