Some 180,000&nbsp;people have fled their homes between 29 April and 9 May. Many people are without shelter, living in open spaces. Between 29 April and 9 May, 18 health facilities&nbsp;were attacked and are now out of service. At least three medical workers have been killed. The northwestern region was declared a demilitarised zone under a deal between Turkey and Russia in September 2018 which aimed to avert a government assault on the area. The Syrian government has stepped up their attacks claiming they have been targeting extremist groups in the area.<a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 07/05/2019https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Latest_Developments_in_north_western_Syria_20190507_FINAL_0.pdfOCHA 17/05/2019https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Latest_Developments_in_north_western_Syria_20190517_SitRep2_1.pdf\">?</a><a href=\"#\" title=\"Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations 05/05/2019https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/breaking-3-hospitals-bombed-today-syriaREUTERS 04/05/2019https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-rebels-kurds/turkey-backed-syrian-rebels-launch-attack-into-kurdish-held-area-idUSKCN1SA0KW\">?</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
