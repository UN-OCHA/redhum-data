The impact on civilians, infrastructure and fields has been devastating; at least three IDP settlements, one refugee camp, 25 schools and 20 health facilities have been affected by a new wave of barrel bomb attacks and artillery strikes. The civilian death toll continues to rise and has likely surpassed 250 people. Access is severely limited, and needs persist across all sectors (especially protection, food, shelter, health and WASH). The northwestern region was declared a demilitarised zone under a deal between Turkey and Russia in September 2018 which aimed to avert a government assault on the area. The Syrian government has stepped up their attacks claiming they have been targeting extremist groups in the area.&nbsp;<a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Reuters 26/05/2019 https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-syria-security-northwest/syrian-government-steps-up-air-strikes-in-northwest-seizes-small-town-idUKKCN1SW0Q8Al Jazeera 29/05/2019 https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/20-civilians-killed-attacks-syria-northwest-190528194504210.htmlReuters 28/05/2019 https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-syria-security-northwest-fires/satellite-images-show-fields-in-northwest-syria-on-fire-idUKKCN1SY1QBOCHA 24/05/2019 https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/syria-situation-report-3-recent-developments-northwestern-syria-24-mayUNSC 28/05/2019 https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/further-military-action-syria-s-north-west-will-overwhelm-all-ability\">?</a><a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 07/05/2019https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Latest_Developments_in_north_western_Syria_20190507_FINAL_0.pdfOCHA 17/05/2019https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Latest_Developments_in_north_western_Syria_20190517_SitRep2_1.pdf\">?</a><a href=\"#\" title=\"Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations 05/05/2019https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/breaking-3-hospitals-bombed-today-syriaREUTERS 04/05/2019https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-rebels-kurds/turkey-backed-syrian-rebels-launch-attack-into-kurdish-held-area-idUSKCN1SA0KW\">?</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","latest_developments_upcoming":""}
