The region was declared a demilitarised zone under a deal between Turkey and Russia in September 2018. The deal aimed to avert a government assault on the area possibly driving millions of refugees into neighbouring Turkey. The Syrian government has stepped up its attacks in recent months claiming they have been targeting &ldquo;terrorist groups&rdquo; in the area. The escalation of violence between regime forces and opposition groups has killed over 200 civilians, including many children, and displaced over 120,000 people across Aleppo, Idlib and Hama governorates since February 2019.<a href=\"#\" title=\"Al Jazeera 02/05/2019https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/russian-syrian-forces-escalate-attacks-rebel-held-areas-190502155942281.htmlOCHA 25/04/2019https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/statement-panos-moumtzis-regional-humanitarian-coordinator-syria-9\">?</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>04/04:&nbsp;</strong>Torrential rainfall since 30 March is causing floods in northern provinces of Idlib, Aleppo and Haskeh.
