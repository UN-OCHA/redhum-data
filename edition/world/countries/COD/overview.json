Conflict is between foreign, self-defence, and other armed groups, and mainly impacting the eastern provinces. Although the security situation has improved slightly since 2013, conflict continues. Access remains volatile in the east, and lack of infrastructure is a general problem across the country. Fighting and insecurity is mostly affecting populations in Sud- and Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Since mid-August 2016, the security situation in the Kasai region has significantly deteriorated due to&nbsp;attacks by Kamuina Nsapu militia, and clashes between FARDC and the militia.&nbsp;Health is a priority due to recurrent measles, cholera, and malaria outbreaks, and protection concerns are high.&nbsp;</p><p>A presidential election is due in 2017, and it has been agreed that President Kabila, whose term limit ended in December 2016, will then step down.
