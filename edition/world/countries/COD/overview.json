Conflict is between foreign, self-defence, and other armed groups, and mainly impacting the eastern provinces. Access remains volatile in the east, and lack of infrastructure is a general problem across the country. Fighting and insecurity is mostly affecting populations in Sud- and Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Maniema, Tanganyika, and Haut-Katanga provinces. Since mid-August 2016, the security situation in the Kasai region has significantly deteriorated due to attacks by Kamuina Nsapu militia, and clashes between FARDC and the militia. Health is a priority need due to recurrent measles, cholera, and malaria outbreaks, and protection concerns are high. <br>The presidential election, postponed from December 2016 to the end of 2017, has been rescheduled for December 2018. At least 50 people died in election-related violence in 2016. <br>INFORM measures DRC's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be very high, at 7.1/10. Lack of coping capacity is of particular concern, at 8/10 as well as vulnerability at 7.3/10.</p>"}
