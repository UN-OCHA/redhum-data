Hostilities between Oromo and Somali groups over border demarcations and resources have led to significant casualties, deaths, and displacement. Fighting escalated in Jijiga (eastern Somali region) at the beginning of August. Intercommunal violence has displaced people in the SNNP region (Gedeos) and Oromia region (Gujis) since April and in Benishangul-Gumuz and Oromia regions&nbsp;since September. There are 2.6 million IDPs in the country.&nbsp;<a href=\"#\" title=\"Crisis Group 03/09/2018 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/CrisisWatch_ICG%20August%202018.pdf ACLED 25/09/2018 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/acleddata.com-Regional%20Overview%20%20Africa%2024%20September%202018.pdf\">?</a></p><p>Consecutive&nbsp;below-average rainy seasons have caused severe drought across northern, eastern, and central Ethiopia.<a href=\"http://www.fews.net/east-africa/ethiopia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FEWSNET 31/01/2017\">?</a>&nbsp;However, the 2018<em>&nbsp;belg</em>&nbsp;rainfall season (February-June) led to flooding along river basins in Oromia, Somali and SNNP regions, affecting some 382,000 people and displacing some 172,000 people in Somali region alone.<a href=\"#\" title=\"HDRP MYR 08/10/2018 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2018_myr_oct08j.pdf\">?</a></p><p>Hosting over 900,000 refugees from neighbouring countries, including 420,000 from South Sudan, most of Ethiopia&rsquo;s refugee camps have reached full capacity.
