Drought also occurs, primarily in the southern region. The recurrence of these events has increased population’s vulnerability with detrimental effects on food security and nutrition. Climatic prediction for the 2018-2019 rainy season indicates normal to below normal rainfall for the southern and central regions, and normal to above normal rainfall for the northern part. The likelihood of an El Niño event in 2019 poses a high risk to the cropping season, especially in the southern drought affected regions. An estimated 2 million people are severely food insecure (IPC 3 and above), including some 800,000 in need of life-saving assistance. The most affected provinces are Gaza, Cabo Delgado, Inhambane, Sofala and Tete.</p>\n\n<p>An Islamist insurgency is ongoing in Cabo Delgado since October 2017, with militants carrying out violent attacks against villages, burning houses, killing people, and leading to thousands of people displaced. The army’s response has driven further abuses and protection needs on the local population by security forces.</p>\n\n<p>On 22 January Tropical Storm Desmond caused heavy flooding in Beira, Chinde and Quelimane and displaced approximately 120,000 people across Zambézia, Sofala, Manica and Tete provinces.</p>\n\n<p>INFORM measures Mozambique’s risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster for 2019 to be high, at 6/10, the same as in 2018. Mozambique’s vulnerability is measured at 6.5/10 and lack of coping capacity at 6.6/10.</p>"}
