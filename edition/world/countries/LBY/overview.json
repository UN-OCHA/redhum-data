The GNC has lost control of Tripoli since the GNA moved to the city from Tunis in early 2016, but remains associated with some Islamist-leaning militias in the capital. These fight occasionally with groups allied with the GNA.</p><p>1.3 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assisstance as the result of a conflict&nbsp;that has generated shortages of food, fuel, water, medical supplies, and electricity, as well as reduced access to healthcare and public services.<a href=\"https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/2017_libya_humanitarian_needs_overview_november_2016_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"OCHA 15/11/2016\">?</a>&nbsp;Much of the fighting takes place in urban centres, posing serious security concerns for civilian populations.
