Multiple parties are fighting for control of the country. Libya is divided among two governments: the House of Representatives (HOR) based in eastern Libya and a UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli. Both governments rely on the support of militias, and alliances are subject to local territorial and political interests. The Libyan National Army (LNA), a mix of tribal or regional-based armed groups allied with the HOR is another key player.<a href=\"#\" title=\"Al Jazeera 13/11/2018https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/italy-libya-talks-commitments-joint-statement-181113195007538.html \">?</a></p><p>Insecurity has greatly limited humanitarian access and hindered the planning and delivery of humanitarian assistance.
