The country has been in a state of civil war since 2014, generating shortages of food, fuel, water, medical supplies and electricity, as well as reduced access to healthcare and public services. <br>Health, protection, shelter and NFIs are main reported needs, for both displaced and host population. <br>INFORM measures Libya's risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster to be high, at 6.0/10. Hazard and exposure as well as lack of coping capacity are of particular concern, at 8.4/10 and 6.7/10 respectively.</p>"}
