Darfur has been the scene of conflict for over a decade, while violence in Blue Nile and South Kordofan increased significantly after South Sudan gained independence in 2011. &nbsp;Humanitarian access to conflict zones is severely restricted and remains so despite efforts of the AU and UN to broker a peace agreement and ensure increased humanitarian access. &nbsp;Violence, food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to basic services have caused large-scale internal displacement. &nbsp;According to INFORM, Sudan is at high risk of being overwhelmed by humanitarian crises and disasters (7/10). Hazard, vulnerability, and a lack of coping capacity are at alarming rates of 7.4/10, 6.6/10, and 7/10</p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>11/08:&nbsp;</strong>Torrential rains in <a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/sudan/crisis-analysis#datacard-33645\">Al Fatasha camp</a> in Sudan&#39;s Omdurman city have destroyed the shelters of thousands of South Sudanese refugees.<a href=\"https://radiotamazuj.org/en/news/article/south-sudan-refugees-in-omdurman-suffer-from-heavy-rains\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Radio Tamazuj 11/08/2017\">?</a></p><p><strong>06/08: </strong>Cholera has been reported in<a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/sudan/crisis-analysis#datacard-33447\"> Central Darfur</a>.
