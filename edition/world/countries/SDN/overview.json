Darfur has been the scene of conflict for over a decade, while violence in Blue Nile and South Kordofan increased significantly after South Sudan gained independence in 2011. &nbsp;</p><p>Humanitarian access to conflict zones is severely restricted and remains so despite efforts of the AU and UN to broker a peace agreement and ensure increased humanitarian access. &nbsp;Violence, food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to basic services have caused large-scale internal displacement. &nbsp;</p><p>According to INFORM, Sudan is at high risk of being overwhelmed by humanitarian crises and disasters (7.6/10).
