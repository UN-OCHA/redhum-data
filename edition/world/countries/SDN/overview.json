Darfur has been the scene of conflict for over a decade, while violence in Blue Nile and South Kordofan increased significantly after South Sudan gained independence in 2011. &nbsp;</p><p>Humanitarian access to conflict zones is severely restricted and remains so despite efforts of the AU and UN to broker a peace agreement and ensure increased humanitarian access. &nbsp;Violence, food insecurity, malnutrition, and lack of access to basic services have caused large-scale internal displacement. &nbsp;</p><p>According to INFORM, Sudan is at high risk of being overwhelmed by humanitarian crises and disasters (7.6/10). Hazard, vulnerability, and a lack of coping capacity are at alarming rates of 8.1/10, 6.9/10, and 7.9/10.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.inform-index.org/Countries/Country-Profile-Map\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Inform 2018\">?</a></p>","latest_developments_past":"<p><strong>28/08:<a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/sudan/crisis-analysis#d-5805-Overview-\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.acaps.org/country/sudan/crisis-analysis#d-5805-Overview-\">Flash floods</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>have left at least 26 people dead, 61 injured, more than 10,000 houses damaged and at least 50,000 displaced countrywide.
