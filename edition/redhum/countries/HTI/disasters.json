There has also been a notable reduction in the number of displaced people living in official shelters in BVI and Dominica. In Dominica, this includes a 60 per cent decrease over the last few weeks.<br>\nThe majority of children in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, and Turk and Caicos Islands have now gone back to school, with all public schools reopening. However, in Dominica just around a third of national schools were open as of 10 November, and 87 per cent of children living in collective shelters still do not have access to any type of education, and are missing out on valuable months of their schooling, which could have implications on the quality of their education.

The Dominica Electricity Services reported that services are in process of being restored throughout the island. Diverse foodstuffs have reappeared on the markets, shops are reopening, most public schools have reopened, and 30 out of 43 damaged water systems have been provisionally repaired. The curfew was lifted in Roseau on 8 December. Nevertheless, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods1. To date, 8 collection centres are still open.<br>\nThe impact of the hurricanes went beyond physical infrastructure. Routine visits to health centers and hospital care were interrupted until those facilities could be repaired. There was damage to structures and to critical systems such as water, electricity, and communications. There was also damage to high-cost specialized equipment and medical supplies. Damages to roadways hindered the arrival of supplies to the affected facilities, which also affected health care.2 Humanitarian actors are transitioning from relief to recovery - oriented activities and coordination mechanisms are reflecting this shift. A growing number of ministries and stakeholders take part in sector coordination mechanisms, which is conducive to more comprehensive and complementary action plans.
