The Dominica Electricity Services reported that services are in process of being restored throughout the island. Diverse foodstuffs have reappeared on the markets, shops are reopening, most public schools have reopened, and 30 out of 43 damaged water systems have been provisionally repaired. The curfew was lifted in Roseau on 8 December. Nevertheless, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods. To date, 8 collection centres are still open.
