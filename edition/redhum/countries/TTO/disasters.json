[{"id":46838,"name":"Trinidad y Tobago: Inundaciones - Oct 2018","description":"<p>On 18 - 19 October, Trinidad and Tobago experienced torrential rainfall, according to Government officials, Trinidad alone received a full month’s worth of rain during the two days. It was estimated 80% of the country was affected by flooding, communities, main roads and public services were affected. On 20 October, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago activated its National Emergency Operations Centre and began assessments. As of now the Government has not requested international support. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2845633\">OCHA, 23 Oct 2018</a>)</p>\n\n<p>The persistent rainfall has caused flooding in approximately 80 per cent of the country, primarily the north, east and central parts of the island nation such as Sangre Grande, Matelot, La Horquetta, St. Helena, Caroni and Mayaro. There are reports from ODPM and CDEMA’s Situation Report #1 that the flooding has impacted 100,000 to 150,000 people. Additionally, official reports from ODPM and CDEMA indicate that 800 people sought shelter in collective centres during th the peak of the emergency; however, the colletive centre population is decreasing as affected people return home to begin the cleanup process.

These prolonged conditions aggravated the situation of 3.8 million food-insecure people in the country. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1090581\">ACAPS, 21 Jul 2015</a>)<br>\nIn July 2016, (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1604401\">OCHA</a>) reported that 2015-2016 drought has caused losses of up to 70 percent of local production and has worsened the situation of food insecurity. It also highlighted that of the 193 million US dollars requested in April 2016 as part of the Humanitarian Response Plan, about 105 million (nearly 60 percent) were allocated to the sector, although about 30 percent (31 million) of the total amount requested were received at the time.<br>\nAn assessment conducted by the CNSA and WFP in December 2016 shows the number of people facing hunger and food insecurity in Grande-Anse and Sud - the most affected areas - has declined steadily from approximately 1 million to 400,000. However, in the North West, Artibonite, Nippes and La Gonave, although the impact of <strong>Hurricane Matthew</strong> was smaller, its effects coupled with three years of drought and severe flooding have led to a hike in the levels of food insecurity with one million people affected. In total, more than 1.5 million people are food insecure in those six areas following this series of shocks.

The project will cover 90,000 individuals of which almost 38,000 are children.

More than 2 000 temporary jobs in plant nurseries for the production of 1.8 million seedlings are expected. In addition, 3 670 temporary jobs will be also created by cleaning primary, secondary and tertiary irrigation canals (33 km), agriculture land and watershed.
