These prolonged conditions aggravated the situation of 3.8 million food-insecure people in the country. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1090581\">ACAPS, 21 Jul 2015</a>)<br>\nIn July 2016, (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1604401\">OCHA</a>) reported that 2015-2016 drought has caused losses of up to 70 percent of local production and has worsened the situation of food insecurity. It also highlighted that of the 193 million US dollars requested in April 2016 as part of the Humanitarian Response Plan, about 105 million (nearly 60 percent) were allocated to the sector, although about 30 percent (31 million) of the total amount requested were received at the time.<br>\nAn assessment conducted by the CNSA and WFP in December 2016 shows the number of people facing hunger and food insecurity in Grande-Anse and Sud - the most affected areas - has declined steadily from approximately 1 million to 400,000. However, in the North West, Artibonite, Nippes and La Gonave, although the impact of <strong>Hurricane Matthew</strong> was smaller, its effects coupled with three years of drought and severe flooding have led to a hike in the levels of food insecurity with one million people affected. In total, more than 1.5 million people are food insecure in those six areas following this series of shocks. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1864074\">CNSA/WFP/FAO 18 Jan 2017</a>)<br>\nIn late January 2017, FEWS forecasted that emergency food assistance needs will remain high until &quot;Printemps&quot; harvests in July 2017, further claiming that unless agricultural assistance is provided, many in southwestern Haiti will likely be unable to cultivate, limiting improvements from the harvest. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1873914\">FEWS 25 Jan 2017</a>) <br>\nAs of March 2017, UNICEF informed that 20 communes and localities have been selected and validated, in conjunction with OREPA/DINEPA, to benefit from the WASH/USAID drought project in the departments of South and Grand’Anse was carried out in conjunction with the Southern Prioritization Matrix. The project will cover 90,000 individuals of which almost 38,000 are children. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1933149\">UNICEF, 7 Mar 2017</a>)  <br><br>\nFrom March to June 2017, FAO-Haiti has been implementing some activities of cash-for-work in the South, South East and Grand&#39;Anse departments, as response to the effects of Hurricane Matthew. More than 2 000 temporary jobs in plant nurseries for the production of 1.8 million seedlings are expected. In addition, 3 670 temporary jobs will be also created by cleaning primary, secondary and tertiary irrigation canals (33 km), agriculture land and watershed.

(<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1671686\">IFRC, 26 Aug 2016</a>) <br>\nAs of 28 October 2016, WFP declared that despite the heavy rains brought by <strong>Hurricane Matthew</strong>, hydraulic drought continues to represent a challenge to public water supply and agricultural production. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1776236\">WFP, 30 Oct 2016</a>) <br>\nOn 2 December, the IFRC DREF operation was extended by 15 additional days as the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) continues to have difficulties accessing drinking water in the province of Santiago. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1806044/\">IFRC, 2 Dec 2016</a>) <br>\nIn January 2017, WFP highlighted that the Cuban Institute of Hydraulic Resources recently stressed that drought continues to represent a challenge to public water supply and agricultural production in the whole country, particularly in the eastern region. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/1906813\">WFP, 31 Jan 2017</a>)<br>\nIn March 2017, WFP stated that it continues assisting the populations affected by hurricane Matthew in eastern Cuba through rice, beans, and vegetable oil distribution. Furthermore, WFP has also been strengthening food storage capacities in the hardest-hit municipalities with mobile storage units and lightning.

Although official planting data is not yet available, preliminary reports point to a normal start to the season with some localized dryness.
