The Dominica Electricity Services reported that services are in process of being restored throughout the island. Diverse foodstuffs have reappeared on the markets, shops are reopening, most public schools have reopened, and 30 out of 43 damaged water systems have been provisionally repaired. The curfew was lifted in Roseau on 8 December. Nevertheless, Dominica remains seriously impacted. Over 80 percent of houses still have inadequate roofing, many children have not yet returned to school and a sizeable portion of the population is highly vulnerable due to the loss of their main source of livelihoods. To date, 8 collection centres are still open.

A growing number of ministries and stakeholders take part in sector coordination mechanisms, which is conducive to more comprehensive and complementary action plans. Finally, the Ministry of Planning has taken over multi-sector coordination from the Dominican government’s Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).

Bean prices follow a seasonal trend and remain slightly below average. In Haiti maize and black bean prices show a stable trend while imported rice remains above average. Until January 2019, the dry corridor of Central America and certain areas in Haiti (Nord, Nord-Est and Ouest) that were affected by the rain deficit are classified in Stress (IPC, Phase 2), while the rest of the region faces Minimum (IPC, Phase 1) food insecurity.

They will be facing Crisis (IPC, Phase 3) Food Security outcomes, particularly in Haiti, Guatemala and Honduras. The rest of the region will be in Stressed or Minimal (IPC, Phase 1 and 2) Food Insecurity.

In the southeastern region of Honduras, Central and Northern Nicaragua and the Dry Corridor in Guatemala, Primera crops have been affected due to irregular rainfall. In Haiti, below average precipitations have impacted Spring crops while Summer harvest remains uncertain.
